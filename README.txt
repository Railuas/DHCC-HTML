Abike Montessori – Mobile Fix Pack
==================================

Files:
- index.html          → your index with a <link> to mobile-fix.css and <script> to mobile-fix.js
- mobile-fix.css      → responsive container + grid + card polish (non-destructive, overrides your current CSS)
- mobile-fix.js       → optional mobile menu toggle (uses #menuToggle and #nav if present)

How to deploy:
1) Backup your current site.
2) Upload index.html to your web root, replacing the old one.
3) Upload mobile-fix.css and mobile-fix.js to the same folder as index.html.
4) Clear cache / hard refresh on phone.

Notes:
- This pack doesn’t remove or rename any of your existing assets; it only overrides styles safely.
- If you have a different menu structure, the JS won’t break anything; it only runs when #menuToggle and #nav exist.
- If any section still looks off, tell me the section name and I’ll tailor the CSS.
